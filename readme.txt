This is a project I was working on for FreeCodeCamp, it came with a certain amount of boilerplate set up, but the unit, functional tests, routes and converter handler code
was made by me. It converts Gallons, Liters, Kilometers, Miles, Kilograms and Pounds. I'll be coming back to add a more freindly front end face to it later.
